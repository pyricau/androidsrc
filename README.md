# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Developers write better apps when they can [read the source](https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/). Unfortunately, the sources for the Android framework and various Google Android libraries are scattered all over the web.

This page helps Android developers find the sources they're looking for.

  * [Compose](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:compose/)
  * [Fragment](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:fragment/)
  * [Hilt Jetpack extensions](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:hilt/)
  * [Navigation](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:navigation/)
  * [Paging](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:paging/)

  * [WorkManager](https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:work/)
* That repository is also synced [to GitHub](https://github.com/androidx/androidx)
    * You can contribute via GitHub to a [subset of projects](https://github.com/androidx/androidx#contribution-guide) (experimental workflow). You can also contribute by clicking **Edit Code** in a file on cs.android.com, which should work for all projects in that repository.
